## My process

I used TDD. I wrote up one test at a time and made it pass before I focused on the next part of the challenge. After everything was tested and every component was in the appropriate place I styled the project accordingly with Tailwindcss and added Alpine.js Intersect animations.

### Built with

- [VUE.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/) - Javascript framework - used because I really like working with it and enjoy the workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework - used because I like working with it and it enables me to style components quickly, meaning I can use my time for other things that I find more important (like testing).
- [Alpine Intersect Plugin](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/intersect)- used for animation
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - used for unit testing Vuejs components
- [Vue test utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/installation/)
- [Vue testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/vue-testing-library/intro)
- [DOM testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/install)
- [User event testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/install)
- [Jest dom testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-jest-dom)
