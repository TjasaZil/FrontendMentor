## Build with:

- [VUE.js](https://cli.vuejs.org/) - Javascript framework - used because I really like working with it and enjoy the workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework - used because I like working with it and it enables me to style components quickly, meaning I can use my time for other things that I find more important (like testing).
- [Alpine Intersect Plugin](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/intersect)- used for animation
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - used for unit testing Vuejs components
- [Vue test utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/installation/) - used in conjunction with Jest
